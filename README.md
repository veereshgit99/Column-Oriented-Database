# Column-Oriented-Database
● Implemented a project, aimed at constructing a column-oriented DBMS using modules from MiniBase. Utilized 
MiniBase modules as foundational elements for building the column-oriented DBMS, focusing on functionalities like 
indexing, sorting, and query processing. 
● Expanded upon the initial implementation by refining the design and incorporating additional features such as 
compressed bitmap file structures and query processing operations like nested loop joins and duplicate elimination. 
● Tech: MiniBase, Java
