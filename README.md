# Column-Oriented-Database
1. Implemented a project, aimed at constructing a column-oriented DBMS using modules from MiniBase. Utilized MiniBase modules as foundational elements for building the column-oriented DBMS, focusing on functionalities like indexing, sorting, and query processing.
2. Expanded upon the initial implementation by refining the design and incorporating additional features such as compressed bitmap file structures and query processing operations like nested loop joins and duplicate elimination.
3. Tech: MiniBase, Java
